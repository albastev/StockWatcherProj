# StockWatcherProj

This simple project allows a user to add a number of stocks, and view their quotes.

One or multiple comma separated stock symbols may be added at once.
Symbols are stored in localStorage between sessions.

It presently does not use any external code with the exception of a small AJAX snippet.
We may want to add a library to decrease likelihood of browser incompatibility.

Next steps:

* delete stock button on the tiles
* update timer
* tie enter to add button
* add nice font stacks
